*pipedat* is a R package that provides analytical pipelines to access,
load, and format a variety of data from multiple sources
programatically. The goal of *pipedat* is to enhance the capacity
scientists, planners and the wider public to prepare and perform complex
and reproducible ecosystem-scale assessments requiring the integration
of multiple spatial datasets such as cumulative effects assessments in
the context of ecosystem-based management, and Marxan analyses for the
establishment of individual and networks of MPAs. In its current format,
*pipedat* is strictly experimental and in development. We are however
hoping to further develop this initiative in the hopes of greatly
enhancing the efficiency, transparency and reproducibility of
large-scale environmental assessments.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `pipedat` is to use
[`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Environment-Health/pipedat")
```

Then, load it:

``` r
library(pipedat)
```

## Main features

The `pipedat` package is built around function called `pipedat()` that
is used to access, load and format a wide variety of data; this function
calls on a series of individual scripts built to access data
programmatically and reproducibly, which we refer to as *data
pipelines*. Individual data pipelines are executed by using their
*unique identifier*, which are specific to the `pipedat` package. The
full list of data pipelines available can be viewed with the
`pipelist()` function:

``` r
# View list of pipelines 
# pipelist()

# Download and format a single dataset 
# pipedat("a3jsd4jh")

# Download and format multiple datasets
# pipedat(c("a3jsd4jh","a8732975y","soif8yiao"))
```

The `pipedat()` function will export the raw and formatted data in the
folder ‘data/pipedat/’.

| d6b6f3fa    | Groundfish and shrimp annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (CCGS Teleost 2004 - 2021) | Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) conducts an annual multidisciplinary scientific survey with a bottom trawl in the Estuary and the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence since 1978. Over the years this survey has been conducted on four vessels: the MV Gadus Atlantica (1978-1994), the MV Lady Hammond (1984-1990), the CCGS Alfred Needler (1990-2005) and the CCGS Teleost (2004-2021). It is important to note that the objectives, the methods used and the identification of the species during these surveys have improved over time in response to DFO requests and mandates. The data are therefore not directly comparable between these surveys.                                                                           | Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2022e)                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## How to contribute

External contributors are welcome to contribute data pipelines to this
package. Simply fork the [public repo]() and create your own data
pipeline. The `pipenew()` function creates a `dp_#####.R` template for
you to use to create a new data pipeline with a unique id. Create a pull
request for us to review the data pipeline for inclusion in the package.

A single pull request per pipeline should be created, and merged pull
requests should be squashed into a single commit.
