Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory

The Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory includes information on all known federal contaminated sites under the custodianship of departments, agencies and consolidated Crown corporations as well as those that are being or have been investigated to determine whether they have contamination arising from past use that could pose a risk to human health or the environment. The inventory also includes non-federal contaminated sites for which the Government of Canada has accepted some or all financial responsibility. It does not include sites where contamination has been caused by, and which are under the control of, enterprise Crown corporations, private individuals, firms or other levels of government.

Native Land Digital

Native Land is an app to help map Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages. The map provided does not represent or intend to represent official or legal boundaries of any Indigenous nations. To learn about definitive boundaries, contact the nations in question. Also, the map is not perfect -- it is a work in progress with tons of contributions from the community. Please send fixes to info@native-land.ca if you find errors.
